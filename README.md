## 🛠 Future Enhancements
- Looking to add a search bar that will search the NY Times archive up until the prior 30 days.
- Want to add a small weather widget in the top right corner.
- Would like to add a modal and have the articles take up less space on the page overall & enable viewers to see each abstract one at a time.
- Upload multiple API sources and a search bar to search all databases.
